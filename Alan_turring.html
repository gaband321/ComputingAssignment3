<p>Alan Turing (born June 23, 1912, London, England—died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire) was a British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life.</p>
<h2>How did he become so famous?</h2>
<p>Alan Turing became famous primarily for his pivotal role in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II, using a machine he helped develop called the Bombe.</p>
<p> which significantly contributed to the Allied victory; he is also widely recognized as a foundational figure in computer science for his theoretical work on computation, including the concept of the Turing Machine and the Turing Test, which is considered a key benchmark for artificial intelligence.</p>
