            Firefighters made progress over the weekend in containing the Palisades and Eaton fires but warn that the return of high winds - forecast until Wednesday - could see these two spread again, or fuel new ones.

            The fires are already among the most destructive in LA's history when measured by the number of buildings destroyed. Rebuilding work will cost "tens of billions" of dollars, <i>US president joe biden</i> has said.
