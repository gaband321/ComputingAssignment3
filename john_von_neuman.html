<h1>john von nueman</h1>
<p>John von Neumann  (December 28, 1903 February 8, 1957) was a Hungarian and American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist and engineer.</p>
 <P>Von Neumann had perhaps the widest coverage of any mathematician of his time, integrating pure and applied sciences and making major contributions to many fields, including mathematics, physics, economics, computing, and statistics.</P>
<p> He was a pioneer in building the mathematical framework of quantum physics, in the development of functional analysis, and in game theory, introducing or codifying concepts including cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer.</p>
<p>His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.</p>
<h2>How did he become so famous?</h2>
<p>John von Neumann became famous for his groundbreaking contributions to multiple fields, including mathematics, physics, and computer science, most notably for laying the theoretical foundation for modern computers by conceptualizing the "stored program computer" design, pioneering game theory, and establishing a significant portion of the mathematical framework for quantum mechanics; essentially making him a key figure in the development of both the atomic bomb and early computers. </p>
<h3>Intresting facts about john von neumann</h3>
<p><i>John von Neumann</i> (born December 28, 1903, Budapest, Hungaryâ€”died February 8, 1957, Washington, D.C., U.S.) was a Hungarian-born American mathematician. As an adult, he appended von to his surname; the hereditary title had been granted his father in 1913.</p>
 <p> Von Neumann grew from child prodigy to one of the worlds foremost mathematicians by his mid-twenties. Important work in set theory inaugurated a career that touched nearly every major branch of mathematics.</p>
<p> Von Neumanns gift for applied mathematics took his work in directions that influenced quantum theory, automata theory, economics, and defense planning. Von Neumann pioneered game theory and, along with Alan Turing and Claude Shannon, was one of the conceptual inventors of the stored-program digital computer.</p>
